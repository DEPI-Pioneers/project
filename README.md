## üìÅ Dataset Overview
- **Source**: [ Data link ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)
   
### **Dataset Description:**
  The Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset is a comprehensive collection of anonymized data detailing over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. This dataset encompasses information on user purchase histories, product details, and the sequence of orders, making it a valuable resource for various data analysis projects.   
#### **Dataset Components:**
The dataset is organized into several interconnected tables:
  - **Orders:** Contains information about each order, including the user ID, order sequence number, day of the week, and time of day the order was placed.
  - **Products:** Lists all products available, along with their unique product IDs and corresponding department and aisle IDs.
  - **Order Products:** Details the products included in each order, specifying whether each product is a first-time purchase or a reorder.
  - **Departments:** Provides department IDs and their respective names, categorizing products into broader groups.
  - **Aisles:** Offers aisle IDs and names, further refining the product categorization within departments.

## üìå Methodology

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Collected **Instacart Market Basket** dataset, integrating multiple tables: **orders, products, users, aisles, and departments**.
- Cleaned data by handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and standardizing categorical variables.
- Engineered features such as **"days since last order," "purchase frequency," and "customer recency."**

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering**
- Identified **top-selling products, reorder trends,** and **time-series shopping patterns.**
- Created **basket-level features** (average order size, most purchased category, etc.).
- Applied **dimensionality reduction (PCA)** for optimizing high-dimensional categorical data.

### **3. Customer Segmentation & Behavioral Analysis**
- Used **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** to classify customers into high-value, loyal, and churn-risk segments.
- Implemented **K-Means clustering** for segmentation based on purchase behavior.
- Conducted **market basket analysis (Apriori Algorithm)** to identify frequently purchased product associations.

### **4. Reporting & Business Recommendations**
- Built **interactive dashboards (Power BI, Tableau)** to visualize trends and key insights.
- Recommended **personalized promotions** and **inventory optimizations** based on customer behavior.
- Suggested **marketing strategies** to improve customer retention and maximize revenue.
